# Caption_Teller
This is a Machine Learning Project that uses Huggingface pretrained model to generate captions for an image input. It uses vit-gpt2 caption generating model from huggingface

# How to Use
All you have to do is provide an array of paths for the images that you want to generate caption for in the caption_for() function call as an argument. I have provided some images for testing purposes.

# Requirements
1. transformers library
